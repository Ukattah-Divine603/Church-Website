          </div>
          <p className="det">
            Destiny Christian Church International was founded on the First
            Friday of December, 1999. What began as a simple Tarry Night
            gathering soon became a powerful spiritual movement marked by
            prayer, worship, and deep fellowship. That first meeting was not
            originally planned as the birth of a church. It was a night
            dedicated to seeking God wholeheartedly. However, the impact of that
            gathering was so profound that it was decided that the First Friday
            of every month would be set aside as a Tarry Night — a sacred time
            of waiting, praying, and spiritual renewal. As the monthly meetings
            continued, the fellowship grew steadily. Lives were transformed,
            faith was strengthened, and a clear vision emerged. What started as
            a single night of prayer evolved into an organized church community
            committed to teaching the Word of God, nurturing believers, and
            reaching out to the wider community. Today, Destiny Christian Church
            remains rooted in that original foundation — prayer, devotion, and
            spiritual hunger. The First Friday Tarry Night continues as a
            defining pillar of the ministry, reminding us of where we began and
            the purpose for which we were called.

          <p className="det">
            Destiny Christian Church exists to raise a generation of believers
            who are rooted in prayer, grounded in the Word of God, and empowered
            by the Holy Spirit to transform lives, families, and communities.
            Our mission is to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ with clarity
            and conviction, to build a strong fellowship devoted to worship and
            biblical teaching, and to equip every believer to discover and
            fulfill their God-given purpose. We are committed to maintaining a
            culture of consistent prayer and spiritual renewal, especially
            through our monthly Tarry Night, while reaching out with compassion
            and service to our community.

            <h1>Our Statement Of Faith & Beliefs</h1>
          </div>
          <p className="det">
            At Destiny Christian Church, we believe that the Holy Bible is the
            inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God. It is our final
            guide in matters of faith, doctrine, and Christian living. We
            believe in one God, eternally existent in three persons: God the
            Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. We believe that Jesus
            Christ is the Son of God, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the
            Virgin Mary, fully God and fully man. He lived a sinless life, died
            on the cross for the redemption of humanity, rose again on the third
            day, ascended into heaven, and will return in power and glory. We
            believe that salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ
            alone. It is not earned by works but received as a gift from God.
            Through repentance and faith, individuals are reconciled to God and
            made new creations in Christ. We believe in the ministry and present
            work of the Holy Spirit, who empowers believers for holy living,
            spiritual growth, and effective service. We believe in the
            importance of prayer, worship, fellowship, and the teaching of sound
            doctrine for the growth and maturity of believers. We believe in the
            ordinances of the Church: water baptism by immersion and the Lord’s
            Supper, as instructed in Scripture. We believe in the resurrection
            of the dead, eternal life for those who are in Christ, and eternal
            separation from God for those who reject Him. We believe that the
            Church is the body of Christ, called to reflect His love, proclaim
            His truth, and impact the world through evangelism and compassionate
            service.
